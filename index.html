                    The Eorzean Encyclopedia is written by players for players of Final Fantasy XIV Online.<br>
                    Ensuring reliability and efficiency is the name of the game, but not everyone has the general knowledge or feels lost in the grand scheme of things. Just starting out feels taxing with the amount of physical <i>stuff</i> to do.
                    This guide is the culmination of multiple areas of struggle the author experience through their experience with the game. Treat this website not as a guide but more as a blog for what worked well for the author.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The guides are split into their own unique sections, all covering different areas and aspects of the game. These guides are either indepth or basic depending on the level of complexity of the activity in question.
                    Just because there is a guide, does <strong>NOT MEAN</strong> these guides would work for you. These are guides of strategies and helpful tools the author has used to handle the complexity that is Final Fantasy XIV.
