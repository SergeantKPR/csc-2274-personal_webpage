            <h1>Marketboard Guide</h1>
            <p>
                Ah, the marketboard. One of the most important pieces for player driven economy within Final Fantasy XIV Online. It is also the most heinous aspect of the playerbase to date (excluding some unsavory areas but I refuse to make a guide on that).
                The marketboard is a place for people to sell more commonly found materials and items not marked with an "Unsellable" tag in its description. The overarching problem with this aspect of the game is that it allows players to attempt (emphasis on attempt) to learn micro and macroeconomics.
                That wouldn't be so bad, if the playerbase had any concept of the idea. The marketboard is a vice, placed around players without much wealth to spend, extorting what little gil they have left for a small trickle of items. The guide below won't talk too much about the problems of the marketboard,
                but how to effectively and efficiently use resources at your disposal to make the most of your gil.
