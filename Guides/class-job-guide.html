            <h1>Combat Job Guides</h1>
            <p>Combat jobs are the bread and butter of Final Fantasy XIV Online. These particular sets of classes influence how you play the game and cooperate with other players. These are the classes you start playing as and can pick up new classes as you progress on with the story.
                Some classes are locked behind certain requirements or expansions (more on that in their own individual sections) so be aware that not everything will be available to you at once. Thankfully, there's a plethora of classes to choose from without needing to get any expansions or progress that far in the story.
                Do note that choosing a starting class will put you in <strong>one</strong> of <strong>three</strong> starting locations and you will not be able to pick up classes from another location until you progress in the main story.
