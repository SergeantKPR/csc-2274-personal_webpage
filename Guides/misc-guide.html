            <h1>Miscellaneous Guides</h1>
            <p>
                I will be honest here, there's a lot to do in Final Fantasy XIV Online. 
                So much so, that certain aspects and stuff to do in game has no real purpose in the aforementioned guides on this site. 
                As compensation, this area of the guides covers some (not all) of the more miscellaneous activities one can do on Final Fantasy XIV.
                These guides are, by no means, all there is left to do in Final Fantasy XIV Online; merely other things that I have personally done.
                There's still a lot that I have yet to achieve, but with time, maybe one day I will achieve all there is to do.
