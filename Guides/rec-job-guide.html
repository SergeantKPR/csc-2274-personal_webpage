            <h1>Recreational Job Guides</h1>
            <p>Outside of the main combat jobs there are 3 types of jobs that don't follow the norms. These are split into 2 categories:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Limited Jobs</li>
                    <li>Non-combat Jobs</li>
                </ol>
            <p>The limited jobs are combat jobs with a twist. They are locked roughly 20 levels below the current expansions capacity and have a unique way of obtaining their skills and abilities. They are some of the most powerful jobs, but it comes at a cost: They are unable to participate in a majority of the current content.</p>
            <p>
                Non-combat jobs are the crafters and gatherers that supply the game with resources and materials. 
                These are the jobs that make sure you have food buffs, crafted gear, materia, potions, etc. 
                The jobs themselves are not too difficult to obtain, requiring the player to be level 15 in a current job, but they are the most difficult to master; taking an extremely long amount of time to complete.
