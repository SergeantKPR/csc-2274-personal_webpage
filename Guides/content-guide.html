                <p>The content guides offer insights on the numerous gameplay aspects implemented into Final Fantasy XIV Online. These are split into their own unique categories set by the game developers. These are:</p>
                <ul numbered="false">
                    <li>Dungeons - 4 player missions through unique, yet thematic areas</li>
                    <li>Trials - 8 player challenges of tough bosses</li>
                    <li>Extreme Trials - 8 player challenges of prior trials with more mechanics</li>
                    <li>Unreal Trials - 8 player challenges of previous extreme trials at the current level capacity</li>
                    <li>Raids - 8 man challenges, usually outside of the story</li>
                    <li>Savage Raids - Hardmode versions of the raids</li>
                    <li>Alliance Raids - 24 player raids</li>
                    <li>Chaotic Alliance Raids - 24 player raids with chaotic mechanics</li>
                    <li>Ultimates - The toughest of the tough, 8 players, unforgiving mechanics, picture perfect execution needed</li>
                </ul>
            <p>It sounds like a lot of content (because it is), however each have their own unique quirks and mechanics associated with them. To help ease the burden, most of the aforementioned content is actually restricted behind progressing through the <abbr title="Main Scenario Quest">MSQ</abbr></p>
