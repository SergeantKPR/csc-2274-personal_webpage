            <h1>Farming Guides</h1>
            <p>
                Most people assume farming, without context, means sitting around waiting for plants to grow. In Final Fantasy XIV, this terminology is referring to spending time to gather or obtain specific materials or gear.
                The majority of the playerbase spends many hours to many months grinding sought after gears and mounts (more in their section) that it can be overwhelming when starting off on what to get and where to get it.
                In the guides that follow, each section would break down certain aspects of what and where to farm certain items.
