                Most people assume farming, without context, means sitting around waiting for plants to grow. In Final Fantasy XIV, this terminology is referring to spending time to gather or obtain specific materials or gear.
                The majority of the playerbase spends many hours to many months grinding sought after gears and mounts (more in their section) that it can be overwhelming when starting off on what to get and where to get it.
                In the guides that follow, each section would break down certain aspects of what and where to farm certain items.

            <p>If you are not new to the MMO world, you may have heard something called <dfn><abbr title="Best-in-Slot">BiS</abbr></dfn> being thrown around the communities. These are highly coveted gear pieces that many players attempt to obtain to make their damage numbers reach the absolute best they can.
            Thankfully, not every piece of gear is BiS and you can get by with a lot less, especially if you are uncomfortable with how "competative" certain activities can be. The beauty of Final Fantasy XIV is that you can gear yourself however you want and still be successful at it. The only thing is that as long as you hit the minimum <dfn><abbr title="Item Level">iLvl</abbr></dfn> requirement, you will be cleared to participate in certain contents.
