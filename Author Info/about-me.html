        <h1>About the Author</h1>
        <p>
            Alexander Nadeau is an avid gamer, often spending multiple hours learning and experiencing games differently than most individuals. Instead of playing for gains, he plays for understanding how the games operate and function.
            Spending countless hours of his time experimenting and tweaking strategies that help him efficiently play without causing unnecessary strain or ruining the fun games have to offer. The reasoning behind theese strategies is to offer
            confidence that despite personal limitations with cognitive functionality, that there is some "pattern" to be found.

            He has spent a lot of time, totaling at the time of writing to 2,428 hours, playing FFXIV. Some active, some inactive, but has enough time invested to begin strategizing methods and sharing his findings with the world.
            By no means does he intend for his strategies to resonate with everyone, that is fundamentally impossible, but wants to express his enjoyment for FFXIV in such a way that shows the inner workings of how and why he does what he does.
