Notes about 1-On-1:
- Schedule more time to discuss
- Too much all at once
- Fix issues with the tabs not loading (Can think of a method)

Overarching take-away:
Move back to simplistic way of handling the page

    Hide all pre-existing tab elements behind a blank canvas (hide it in HTML and CSS) [DONE]
    Rewire tabs to be like the old classwork [DONE]
    Apply padding to text elements to make the readability work [DONE]
